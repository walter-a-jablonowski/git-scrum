# Git SCRUM

**Data file based SCRUM system, IDE-integrated, git is backend**

CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT

- Put your tasks as data file in the project folder beside your sources
- Access all your tasks directly in IDE, accessible where you work
- One YML file per task
- Use the repository as backend, all data is synced
- No need for a seperate tool
- No need for a seperate backend, the repository is your multi user backend

git *is* a backend that you already have, why a new one? Possible conflicts are handled through git's merge func.

- Copy contents of /data folder in your project folder beside /src
- Use the GitScrum App (as soon as available)
